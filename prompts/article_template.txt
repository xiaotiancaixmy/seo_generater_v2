Generate a clear and concise SEO-optimized title for the article based on the topic and keyword.

Create a comprehensive SEO-optimized article (total >2,000 words) in English, written in a third-person, educational tone (not first-person or branded).

Topic: {{ title }}
Primary Keyword: {{ main_keyword }}

The article should directly address the topic above, and for each section in the outline, generate a unique and relevant section heading instead of copying the outline title directly:
{{ outline }}

Requirements:
- Follow Google EEAT standards (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)
- Include relevant long-tail keywords and LSI terms related to "{{ main_keyword }}"
- Structure the content for maximum SEO performance
- The article must be at least 1,500 words long. If needed, expand existing sections with more details, examples, or references to meet this minimum word count requirement.

Do not add explicit H2/H3 tags before each section. Instead, use clear section headers in plain text.
- Bullet points of expected content (as needed)
- Use of main and long-tail keywords
- Internal links (to other sections or relevant tools)
- External links to authoritative sources (e.g., studies, documentation, industry sites)

Output Format: HTML

Also include at the end:
- A keyword-rich meta description (max 160 characters)
