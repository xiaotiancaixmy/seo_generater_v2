## Introduction to MVP Launch Plan

### What is an MVP Launch Plan?
An MVP (Minimum Viable Product) launch plan is a strategic roadmap that guides the development and launch of a product with the minimum set of features necessary to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future development. This plan is crucial in Agile project management for ensuring the product meets market needs efficiently.

<p>An MVP launch plan is a strategic roadmap that guides the development and launch of a product with the minimum set of features necessary to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future development. In Agile project management, this plan is essential for aligning the product with market needs efficiently.</p>

<p>Understanding the importance of an MVP launch plan is vital. A Statista report indicates that about 20% of startups fail due to a lack of market need. An effective MVP launch plan can mitigate this risk by ensuring the product aligns with market demands.</p>

<p>In this article, we will explore how to create an MVP launch plan using Agile PM with Remio, highlighting its key features and how it enhances productivity.</p>

Understanding the MVP launch plan is critical in today's competitive market. It enables teams to iterate quickly, gather feedback, and make data-driven decisions. A CB Insights study found that 42% of startups fail because they did not meet a market need, a risk that can be avoided with a well-planned MVP launch.
